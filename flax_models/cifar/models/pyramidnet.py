"""PyramidNet model with ShakeDrop regularization.

Reference:

ShakeDrop Regularization for Deep Residual Learning
Yoshihiro Yamada, Masakazu Iwamura, Takuya Akiba, Koichi Kise
https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02375

Initially forked from
github.com/google/flax/blob/master/examples/cifar10/models/pyramidnet.py

This implementation mimics the one from
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/autoaugment/shake_drop.py
that is widely used as a benchmark.

We use kaiming normal initialization for convolutional kernels (mode = fan_out,
gain = 2.0). The final dense layer use a uniform distribution U[-scale, scale]
where scale = 1 / sqrt(num_classes) as per the autoaugment implementation.

It is worth noting that this model is slighly different that the one presented
in the Deep Pyramidal Residual Networks paper
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02915.pdf), as we round instead of trucating when
computing the number of channels in each block. This results in a model with
roughtly 0.2M additional parameters. Rounding is however the method that was
used in follow up work (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00397,
https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12047) so we keep it for consistency.
